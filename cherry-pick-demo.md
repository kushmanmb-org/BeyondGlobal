This file documents a practical demonstration of the git cherry-pick command, specifically using the range syntax to apply multiple commits.

## Scenario

We needed to bring in Etherscan API functionality commits (7354cad and c5b2c92) from PR #9 into the current branch.

## Command Used

```bash
git cherry-pick 7354cad^..c5b2c92
```

## Explanation

The syntax `A^..B` is used to cherry-pick a range of commits:
- `7354cad^` refers to the parent of commit 7354cad
- `..c5b2c92` specifies the end of the range
- This includes both commits 7354cad and c5b2c92 in the cherry-pick operation

## Result

Both commits were successfully applied:
1. **7354cad** - Implement Etherscan API v2 GET request functionality
2. **c5b2c92** - Fix parameter consistency between function defaults and configuration

## Verification

After cherry-picking, we verified the changes by:
1. Checking the git log to confirm both commits were applied
2. Running `npm test` to ensure all tests passed
3. Verifying that the code files (index.js, test.js, ETHERSCAN_API.md) were present

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the cherry-pick operation correctly brought in the functionality without breaking existing code.
